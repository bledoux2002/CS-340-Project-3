CS 340 Project 3
Participants: Benjamin Ledoux (HBR2056) and Paul McSlarrow (VOJ0336)

Both of us worked on Link State and Distance Vector.
Paul handled Dijkstra's algorithm and Ben handled link/node deletion in Link State.
Work was shared on processing of messages and Bellman Ford.

Unfortunately a lot of test cases fail despite how close we felt our approach was. We would appreciate this being taken into consideration.
